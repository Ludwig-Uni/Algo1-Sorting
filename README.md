## Comparisons of Sorting Algorithms in Python and C++
The codes for the sorting algorithms are in `selectionsort.py`, `selectionsort.cpp`, `quicksort.py` and `quicksort.cpp`.

The answers to all questions including the interesting plots are in the `sorting.ipynb` notebook.

Test cases for selection sort and quicksort in python are in `sorting_tests.py`
